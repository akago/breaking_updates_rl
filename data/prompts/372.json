The new library version includes the following changes:\nFormat: element | nature | kind\nio.dropwizard.setup.Environment | DELETION | TYPE_REMOVED\nio.dropwizard.setup.HealthCheckConfiguration | DELETION | TYPE_REMOVED\nio.dropwizard.setup.Bootstrap | DELETION | TYPE_REMOVED\nio.dropwizard.cli.ConfiguredCommand | DELETION | TYPE_REMOVED\nio.dropwizard.ConfiguredBundle | DELETION | TYPE_REMOVED\nio.dropwizard.Configuration | DELETION | TYPE_REMOVED\nio.dropwizard.Application | DELETION | TYPE_REMOVED\nBefore proposing a fix, please analyze the situation and plan your approach within\n<repair strategy> tags:\n\n- Identify the specific API changes that are causing the failure in the client code. \n- Compare the old and new API versions, noting any changes in method signatures, return types, or parameter lists. \n- Determine which parts of the client code need to be updated to accommodate these API changes. \n- Consider any constraints or requirements for the fix (e.g., not changing function signatures, potential import adjustments). \n- Plan the minimal set of changes needed to fix the issue while keeping the code functional and compliant with the new API. \n- Consider potential side effects of the proposed changes on other parts of the code. \n- Ensure that the planned changes will result in a complete and compilable class. \n- If applicable, note any additional imports that may be needed due to the API changes.  \n- Propose a patch that can be applied to the code to fix the issue. \n- Return only a complete and compilable class in a fenced code block. \n- You CANNOT change the function signature of any method but may create variables if it simplifies the code. \n- You CAN remove the @Override annotation IF AND ONLY IF the method no longer overrides a method in the updated dependency version. \n- If fixing the issue requires addressing missing imports, ensure the correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version. \n- Avoid removing any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error. \n- Return only the fixed class, ensuring it fully compiles and adheres to these constraints.",
